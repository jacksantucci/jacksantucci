I am a political scientist specializing in electoral systems, state/local politics, and behavior. This page is for hosting replication materials not otherwise required by journals. Those repositories are pinned below, and I am still working on others. Additional replication materials can be found via links in my CV at <a href="https://www.jacksantucci.com" target="_blank">jacksantucci.com</a>. Please check back or feel free to e-mail me.
